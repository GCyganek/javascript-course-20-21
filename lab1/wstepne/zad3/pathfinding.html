          Still, I wouldn’t really call blindly following a fixed route intelligent behavior.
          The robot could work more efficiently if it adjusted its behavior to the actualwork that needs to be done.</p>

        <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
          To do that, it has to be able to deliberately move toward a given parcel ortoward 
          the location where a parcel has to be delivered. Doing that, even when the goal is 
          more than one move away, will require some kind of route-finding function.
        </p>
          <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
          The problem of finding a route through a graph is a typicalsearch problem.
          We can tell whether a given solution (a route) is a valid solution, but we 
          can’t directly compute the solution the way we could for 2 + 2. Instead, we 
          have to keep creating potential solutions until we find one that works.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
          The number of possible routes through a graph is infinite. 
          But when search-ing for a route from A to B, we are interested 
          only in the ones that start at A. We also don’t care about 
          routes that visit the same place twice—those aredefinitely 
          not the most efficient route anywhere.  So that cuts down on 
          the number of routes that the route finder has to consider.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row card bg-light" style="margin-top:3vw;padding:1vw">
        <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
          In fact, we are mostly interested in theshortestroute. So we want to makesure
           we look at short routes before we look at longer ones. A good approachwould 
           be to “grow” routes from the starting point, exploring every reachableplace 
           that hasn’t been visited yet, until a route reaches the goal. That way,we’ll 
           only explore routes that are potentially interesting, and we’ll find the <em>shortest</em>
            route (or one of the shortest routes, if there are more than one) to the goal.
        </p>
          <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
            Here is a function that does this:
        </p>
        <pre style="font-size:calc(.9vw + .9vh)" class="card-text text-white bg-dark">
function findRoute(graph, from, to) {
  let work = [{at: from, route: []}];
  for (let i = 0; i < work.length; i++) {
    let {at, route} = work[i];
    for (let place of graph[at]) {
      if (place == to) return route.concat(place);
      if (!work.some(w => w.at == place)) {
        work.push({at: place, route: route.concat(place)});
      }
    }
  }
}
        </pre>
      </div>

      <div class="row card bg-light" style="margin-top:3vw;padding:1vw">
        <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
          The exploring has to be done in the right order—the places that were reached first
           have to be explored first. We can’t immediately explore a place as soonas we 
           reach it because that would mean places reached <em>from there</em> would also be explored 
           immediately, and so on, even though there may be other, shorterpaths that haven’t yet been explored.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
          Therefore, the function keeps a <em>work</em> list. This is an array of places that should be explored next, 
          along with the route that got us there. It starts withjust the start position and an empty route.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
          The search then operates by taking the next item in the list and exploringthat, which means 
          all roads going from that place are looked at. If one of themis the goal, a finished route 
          can be returned. Otherwise, if we haven’t lookedat this place before, a new item is added to 
          the list. If we have looked at itbefore, since we are looking at short routes first, we’ve 
          found either a longerroute to that place or one precisely as long as the existing one, and we don’tneed to explore it.
      </p>
        <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
          You can visually imagine this as a web of known routes crawling out from thestart location,
           growing evenly on all sides (but never tangling back into itself).As soon as the first
            thread reaches the goal location, that thread is traced backto the start, giving us our route.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
        Our code doesn’t handle the situation where there are no more work items on the work
         list because we know that our graph is <em>connected</em>, meaning thatevery location can be
          reached from all other locations. We’ll always be able tofind a route between two points, and the search can’t fail.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row card bg-dark" style="margin-top:3vw;padding:1vw">
        <pre style="font-size:calc(.9vw + .9vh)" class="card-text text-white">
function goalOrientedRobot({place, parcels}, route) {
  if (route.length == 0) {
    let parcel = parcels[0];
    if (parcel.place != place) {
      route = findRoute(roadGraph, place, parcel.place);
    } else {
      route = findRoute(roadGraph, place, parcel.address);
    }
  }
  return {direction: route[0], memory: route.slice(1)};
} </pre>
      </div>

        <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
          This robot uses its memory value as a list of directions to move in, just like the 
          route-following robot.  Whenever that list is empty, it has to figure outwhat to do 
          next. It takes the first undelivered parcel in the set and, if thatparcel hasn’t been 
          picked up yet, plots a route toward it. If the parcel <em>has</em> been picked up, it still needs 
          to be delivered, so the robot creates a route toward the delivery address instead.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:calc(1vw + 1vh)" class="card-text">
          This robot usually finishes the task of delivering 5 parcels in about 16 turns.That’s slightly better 
          than <em>routeRobot</em> but still definitely not optimal.
