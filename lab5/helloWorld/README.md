requires [MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

**use npm install**

then:

**npm run app1** to run app1.js -> test app1: 

* http://localhost:3000/calculate/multiplication/2/3 to perform calculation and save its result to MongoDB database

* http://localhost:3000/results to display saved caluclations from MongoDB database

* http://localhost:3000/json/operation.json to display content of operation.json

the same with app2 (which is using *pug*)
